## <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> Connect with the pyOpenSci community at PyCon US 2024!
We know there are a million things to do and see while at [PyCon US 2024](https://us.pycon.org/2024/) in beautiful Pittsburgh this weekend, so we wanted to compile a list of every talk, keynote, summit, and panel where you can expect to meet some of the fantastic pyOpenSci community members!

### <i class="fa-solid fa-users-between-lines"></i> 11:00--4:30 PM: Maintainers Summit
*Room 402, David L. Lawrence Convention Center*\
The [Maintainers Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/maintainers-summit/), organized by [Inessa Pawson](https://github.com/InessaPawson), [Chris Rose](https://github.com/offbyone), [Kara Sowles](https://github.com/karasowles), and [Leah Wasser](https://github.com/lwasser), is where the Python community comes together to discuss and foster best practices on how to develop sustainable projects and nurture thriving communities. Check out the video below about what to expect at this year's Maintainers Summit produced by PyCon US 2024 Conference Chair [Mariatta Wijaya](https://github.com/readme/stories/mariatta-wijaya):

### <i class="fa-solid fa-comment"></i> 11:45--12:15 PM: Making Beautiful, Publication Quality Tables in Python is Possible in 2024
*Ballroom BC*\
**[Rich Iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone) & [Michael Chow](https://github.com/machow)**\
We couldn't agree more with Rich and Michael when they say that "The display of tables can be beautiful. Tables can convey information effectively, just as plots do and, sometimes, it’s the better way to present data. Truly, the time has come to bridge the divide between raw DataFrame output and wondrously-structured tables suitable for publication." In this talk they'll go over which table components make for effective displays of information, and which combinations of Python packages that fit together to make this important task possible.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-comment"></i> 1:45--2:30 PM: Modern binary build systems
*Ballroom A*\
**[Henry Fredrick Schreiner III](https://github.com/henryiii)**\
Henry will be guiding attendees through how easy it is now to set up a binary extension using CMake, Meson, or Maturin (Rust only). It can be done with only three files each containing only a handful of lines of code. Unlike the previous solutions, this covers cross-compilation,multithreaded builds, modern C++ standards, and other features that would each require custom code in a classic setup.py. Combined with cibuildwheel for building wheels and good support from modern binding tools like pybind11 and nanobind, the barrier for entry to reliable compiled extensions has dropped dramatically.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-comment"></i> 2:45--3:15 PM: Hatch: The only tool you need
*Ballroom A*\
**[Ofek Lev](https://github.com/ofek)**\
It's no secret that we're big fans of Hatch---we even [taught a Python Packaging Workshop](https://www.pyopensci.org/blog/pyos-education-announcement.html#enroll-in-pyopenscis-upcoming-workshop-from-python-code-to-module) using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)! With an ever-growing set of tools used in Python packaging, Ofek will be presenting on how Hatch can be used as a unifying tool for Python packaging.
