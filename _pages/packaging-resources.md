    excerpt: "
Through a single review process, community maintainers:

* Have their package accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem

* Can be [published in JOSS (if in scope)](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/partners/joss.html#)

* Can become an affiliated package with your community, following your community guidelines.

* Are supported in maintaining their tools, with input from our diverse, knowledgeable community, including active members from across the Python, Conda, PyPA and broader Python packaging ecosystem."
